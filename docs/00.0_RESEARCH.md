# 00.0 Research

With 3 hours as the time limit, not a lot of research can be done.  I have therefore made a few check on the API using Postman as well as digging up some API docs that would assist in the development of this prototype.

The follow information is found from a few google search and should be relatively useful.

The following pdf also outlines the image api which can be handy

Not surprising that NASA has a version of something similar:
