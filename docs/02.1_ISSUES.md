# 02.0 Issues

1. React-Scripts v3.4.1 has a bug that causes network data from docker not passed correctly, adding a ```tty: true``` tag in docker-compose fixes it, sometimes. [Here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8688#issuecomment-629245677) is more details about the bug. Therefore downgrading to 3.4.0 is probably a better alternative.
