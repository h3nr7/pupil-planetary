# 02.0 Issues

1. React-Scripts v3.4.1 has a bug that causes network data from docker not passed correctly, adding a ```tty: true``` tag in docker-compose fixes it, sometimes. [Here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8688#issuecomment-629245677) is more details about the bug. Therefore downgrading to 3.4.0 is probably a better alternative.

2. Ran into issue with the mouse position when using racasting, realised it is better to use layerX and layerY to get more accurate mouse position on the canvas.

3.  Probably should have filtered the nasa api search results for less response to be displayed.
