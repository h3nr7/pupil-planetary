# 03.1 Improvements

Plenty however I will list 10 that are important:

1. Tests, no test on the Components for both 3D and 2D.  It is probably more important to do so with effect hooks as well as the ThreeJS classes.

2. Structure is a little basic and definitely not scalable.  Did not look into available React - ThreeJS library, passing function handling event between the React Components and Three Object Classes can be cleaner with more thoughts into it.  

3.  Strongly typed a.k.a. TypeScript, Would have used TypeScript if it is not a test.  It would reduce the number of tests to write as well as keeping a clean reference to data and function types, especially when the project grows.

4. No CI or pipieline to push to any web services.  Would have been nice to have at least a simple pipeline to push to staging.

5. No backend, not the most important for this exercise.

6. Styles are not reusable.

7. No mobile view or any media query for different screen sizes.

8. Not cross browser tested.

9. No loader or transitions.

10. The orbit were not at all true to scale or at least by some logarithmic scale, they are all the same distance a part and assumed to be circular.

p.s. assumed Pluto is still in our solar system?
