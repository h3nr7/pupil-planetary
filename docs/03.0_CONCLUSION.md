# 03.0 Conclusion

The total build time for this ended up to be over by almost double.  Progress wise it was pretty much as listed below:

* 40mins mark - researched and got an understanding of the brief, setup github and build environment
* 2.5 hours mark - The overall structure of the app done with API call working, event handlers working
* 3 hours mark - 2D version done, ThreeJS setup and the sun is in just as a first test.
* 4 hours mark - Panicked as things started to get a little messy, probably a good time to refactor under normal circumstances however had to power on.
* 5 hours mark - Overall requirements are working, things look a little static.
* 5.5 hours mark - Orbiting planets are in.

Underestimated the task.  I knew 3 hours would probably get me somewhere with the 3D part somewhat working however as usual progress was slower at the start and accelerated towards the end.
