# Planetary Demo for Pupil

This is a rapid built using create-react-app to provide a quick and dirty scaffolding, with docker added to the mix for cross OS development.

As there are a few commitments today, I have therefore broken up the tasks and timeslots into 3 phases. with Preparation set for 30minutes for the 1st phase, building out the app in the 2nd and if time allows writing up a conclusion with may be some improvements.
